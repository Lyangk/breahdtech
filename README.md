Hi there!

I'm Angie, an aspiring developer based in Canada

I love turning ideas into lightning fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and tech, you'll find me watching anime, doing sports or playing my guitar. I also enjoy going out with friends and my personal space.

Fun Facts:
- I don't like yogurt or frozen treats
- My current favorite anime is Dr.Stone
